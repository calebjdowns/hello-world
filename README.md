# hello-world

Hi, everyone!

My name is Caleb Downs and I'm trying to learn Ruby, Javascript, HTML, CSS and MySQL in order to develop a website for a literary magazine I created titled SunStruck Magazine. We publish essays, interviews, short fiction and poetry, and we post our content online and in a PDF version of the magazine. Our website is functional right now, but there is so much room for improvement in terms of presenting SunStruck's content, which is why I'd like to learn how to code.
